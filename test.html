			<p><h3>Let me tell you something you already know: Your housekeeper spies on you.</h3>

			We work alone.<br> We get bored.<br> What do you expect?<br>
			<b>I worked for a company cleaning houses for two years.</b><br> It was flexible. It paid well enough. I didn't think of it as a career, or identify with it; it was just what I did to get myself through college as a single mom.

			<em>At first I didn't snoop.</em> When they set me off on my own with a white binder containing directions for each house, I just <h2>dropped my daughter</h2> off at day care and went.</p>
